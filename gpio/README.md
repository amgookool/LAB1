# GPIO Example

This project uses the GPIO example in the sdk to configure and use gpio settings and interrupts.

## GPIO functions

 * GPIO0: input
 * GPIO2: output
 
GPIO0 is configured and it is also set to trigger the interrupt on the falling edge.
The interrupt service routine turns on the LED connected to GPIO2.
